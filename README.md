# Mangrove Monitoring Project
Mangrove monitoring using multitemporal Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance and Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI). These codes are intended to be run in Google Colab environment. So you need to provide a shapefile in Geographic Coordinate Systems (GCS) format in your Google Drive. If the codes are executed in JupyterLab environment, then there will be some modifications to the codes.

### Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI) citation:

Baloloy, A.B., Blanco, A.C., Ana, R.R.C.S., Nadaoka, K., 2020, Development and application of a new mangrove vegetation index (MVI) for rapid and accurate mangrove mapping, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Vol. 166, pp. 95-117. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.06.001.

### Requirement:

You must have a Google Earth Engine account to run this code.
